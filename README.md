##Title: Collaboration. Complex application.

Contents
--------
* Collaboration
* All previously studied things

Mandatory Objectives
--------------------
*	Create an application which has:
    *	Child windows controls
    *	GDI animation
*	Animation should be controlled by controls

Objectives With Points
----------------------
*	Work on this project in a team of 2-4 (2 pt.)
    *	Divide tasks and describe them in readme (for each task indicate who is responsible for it) (1 pt.)
*	Make it useful (you may ask me to evaluate usefulness of your application idea) (0-3 pt.)
*	First create a sketch, then work on code (1 pt.) (commit sketches early)

Application Creation Steps
--------------------------

This Laboratory Work was done in team. We are just two people in team : Bancila Iana and Craganciu Dan.  Our first idea about what topic to choose was to create a Tic-Tac-Toe Game beacause it is our favorite simple game (sometimes we play this game at pairs :D, oops). 
Iana Bancila sketched the whole project interface and created the icons. After that, Iana implemented this interface in application. Dan did the technical part, all logical stuff. At the end we got nice Tic-Tac-Toe Game which has the following functionality: 

1.	At the top of window it is shown who’s turn is (first turn is always crosses turn)
2.	You can restart the game by pushing “restart” button, which means you try one more time to play the game without resetting the scores while “reset” button resets all the scores. 
3.	You can see what score you gained.
4.	When someone wins a message box appears with mention about the winner.
5.	There are two popup menus. First, “Game” menu has two options, to restart and to quit the game and “Help” menu which shows “About” dialog box.

First of all we've sketched our laboratory work on a paper. Designed all the buttons, elements. After that we've added the elements. Then we've set their functionality step by step. And in the end we've added the properties to do stuff.
In order to understand more clearly we made a wireframe model of our application general layout and functionality. Here is the mockup we came up with:

Conclusion
----------

This laboratory work has very interesting task and we really enjoyed doing it. What we liked most is the fact how simple it is.

I think the work we did went smoothly and we had no problems. The process was really simple but we haven’t managed to accomplish all the features that we have planned.
       
Well, this laboratory work was very addictive, our game is very funny. Now we play this game without drawing on paper those lines, its more simple.
